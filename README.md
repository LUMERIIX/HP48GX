# HP48GX
Software for using the Emu48 with an old HP48GX modifyed with an AVR tiny

If you have an old malfunction HP48GX you can modify it with an AVR tiny controller with this Software on it. 
The Schematic and the Layout for the Print you can find soon in a folder right here!!
The Hardware you need is really cheap... The circuit board can be replaced by an development board. 
The circuit board replaces the uC inside the calculater. The connctors of the circuit board must be connect to the correspondig pins on the main circiut board of the calculater (see Schematic of the HP48GX)!

The Software uses VUSB in order to avoid a lot of Hardware! 
The USB cable must be connected on the circuit board and pluged into the PC. 
It's an HID Device so the Driver install itselfe.

If you have questions about Software or Hardware contact me!
